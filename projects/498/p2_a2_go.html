<h3>Description</h3>
For this project, my partner, <a href="https://frnkwang.github.io/">Frank Wang</a>, and I created a Pokemon Go clone, re-themed for the city of Ann Arbor, to encourage visitors to explore the city. Players can learn about the city by walking around to discover different landmarks. Discovering a new landmark unlocks a new tree seed in their shop. Fully-grown trees generate coins which can be used to buy more tree seeds. In the Ann Arbor spirit, the game also has squirrels. A squirrel standing by a tree will prevent the tree from quickly generating coins. The user can enter AR Mode to launch acorns at the squirrels to try and appease them. They can also place a fence around any tree to prevent the squirrels from bugging that tree.

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Two gameplay modes: Interaction Mode (AR) and Exploration Mode (Map), with different music to set the tone</li>
    <li>Orbit camera behavior around the player's avatar when in Exploration Mode</li>
    <li>Persistently north-facing compass to keep the user oriented as they explore the world</li>
    <li>6 different tree types, ranging from realistic to imagined, which generate coins once fully grown</li>
    <li>Plant trees in AR and watch them grow</li>
    <li>Scrollable inventory bar to keep track of seed, acorn, and fence counts</li>
    <li>Shop menu to buy more seeds, acorns, and fences</li>
    <li>Squirrels which spawn at random intervals to prevent trees from generating coins</li>
    <li>Appeasing squirrels with acorns generates DogeCoin, which can be used to buy fences to protect your trees</li>
    <li>Currency boost for spotting the Ann Arbor emblem</li>
</ul>
