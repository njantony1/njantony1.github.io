<h1>DNAVR (Unreal Engine)</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
This project is our capstone project for EECS 498: XR and Society. My team and I were tasked with creating a socially impactful AR/VR app. We chose to create a VR game to teach high school students about the DNA transcription/translation process. Students are responsible for building an mRNA strand by matching nucleotide bases to a strand of DNA, bringing the mRNA to the ribosome, building the protein encoded in the mRNA bringing tRNA to the ribosome to match codon/anticodon pairs, and finally packaging the protein and delivering it to the cell wall.

<h3>Project Development Website</h3>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3D movement throughout a cell model</li>
    <li>Guided tutorial system to tell the player what to do next</li>
    <li>Information cards for each organelle/game object so students can learn about cellular functions</li>
    <li>Grabbable nucleotide bases (A/C/T/G/U)</li>
    <li>An inventory system for storing extra nucleotide bases</li>
    <li>Ability to snap a nucleotide base to the correct matching base on a strand of DNA</li>
    <li>mRNA strand pops off from the DNA strand after it has been successfully built by the player</li>
    <li>Players can take the mRNA strand to a ribosome to begin the translation process</li>
    <li>tRNA preferentially spawns based on which codon/anticodon pair is next in the translation process</li>
    <li>Amino acid chain grows gradually as players bring the correct tRNA over to the ribosome</li>
    <li>Amino chain becomes grabbable once the translation process is complete</li>
    <li>Players can bring the amino acid chain to the Golgi Apparatus to package the protein</li>
    <li>Packaged proteins can be brought to the cell wall to earn "lysocoins" (from the word "lysosome")</li>
    <li>Virus attack functionality: once players build and deliver 2 proteins, a virus will spawn, releasing toxins into the cell which decrease the spawning frequency of nucleotide bases, hindering their progress</li>
    <li>Lysosomes can be bought with "lysocoins" which actively seek out and destroy the virus toxins</li>
    <li>Classroom starting level with a leaderboard for the best time to build 3 proteins</li>
</ul>
